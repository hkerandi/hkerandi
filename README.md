# Hi there 👋🏾 I’m Holiness Kerandi

### Creative Systems Engineer • Data Scientist • XR Explorer

I’m a Computer Science & Engineering student who builds **real systems for real people**.

I design and implement data-driven technologies that operate on messy, real-world constraints — cultural, ethical, and technical.  
My work blends **data engineering, analytical modeling, and interactive system design**, with a focus on **fairness, accessibility, and impact**.

I care deeply about humans — *and* I’m very serious about the computer science.

## 🧠 What I Do (Practically)

- Build and analyze **data pipelines** using Python, SQL, and Pandas  
- Design **schemas and workflows** that surface patterns, bias, and behavior  
- Develop **full-stack applications** that turn complex data into usable tools  
- Prototype **immersive and interactive systems** with WebXR and React  
- Treat ethics, context, and care as **engineering constraints**, not add-ons
