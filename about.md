# About Me  

I'm Holiness — a Computer Science & Engineering student at Bucknell University, working at the intersection of **data, culture, and human-centered technology**.
My interests revolve around understanding how people behave, create meaning, and make decisions — and how we can translate those patterns into responsible, insightful systems.

I grew up in Kenya and study abroad in the U.S., which gives me a global lens on how identity, environment, and technology shape human behavior. My work blends data science, UX thinking, and systems analysis to explore social patterns and build tools that feel intuitive, ethical, and culturally aware.
